saat -y security-scan -m architecture.json --threat-model
saat -y generate-docs -m architecture.json -f markdown -f plantuml
saat -y generate-terraform -m architecture.json -p aws
```
**All steps work end-to-end. Production ready!**

#### Visual Editing - 100% ✅
Round-trip with bac4-standalone:
```bash
saat analyze → export-structurizr → [visual edit] → import-structurizr → generate-terraform
```
**Complete workflow functional. Production ready!**

#### Claude Code Integration - 100% ✅
8 MCP tools with auto-approve mode.
**Fully functional. Production ready!**

#### Greenfield (From Scratch) - 75% ⚠️
